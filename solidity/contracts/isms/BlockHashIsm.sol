/*
Assume you have some magical origin chain block hash oracle on the destination chain.

```solidity
interface IBlockHashOracle {
		uint32 public immutable origin;
		function blockhash(uint256 height) external view returns (uint256 hash);
}
```

Implement a `BlockHashISM` that verifies whether a message was dispatched on the origin chain using this oracle. You can assume that the origin chain uses the [ethereum block format](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/blocks/#block-anatomy). 

When youâ€™re done implementing OptimisticISM, please **create a PR on your forked repo** merging `solidity-challenge` back into `main` and reach back out with a link to this PR. 

We expect this challenge to take a few hours to complete, but feel free to spend as little or as much time as you like. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or feedback.

**Assumptions:**

- BlockHashOracle is trusted
- Relayers are untrusted

**Design goals:**

- Simplicity
- Gas efficiency
